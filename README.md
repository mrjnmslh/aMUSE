## Unsupervised Alignment of Word Embeddings

This codebase is forked from facebook's MUSE which implements [Word Translation without Parallel Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf).

Additions to teh forked codebase implement [Earth Moverâ€™s Distance Minimization for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1207).
